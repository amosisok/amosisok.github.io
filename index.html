      <p>Hello! I am currently a senior at SFU majoring in software systems, a program within the school of computing science. 
        <br><br>
        My passion lies in developing software that will have a positive impact on our society and world. I have experience in full-stack web development using React.js and Node.js, as well as back-development and databases. 
        <br><br>
        
        In my spare time, I enjoy lifting heavy weights, watching various tv shows and the occasional table tennis rally. 
        <br><br>
        Feel free to connect with me through email or LinkedIn!</p>
