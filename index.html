      <p>Hello! I am currently a senior at SFU majoring in software systems, a program within the school of computing science. 
        <br><br>
        My passion lies in developing software that will have a positive impact on our society and world. I have experience in full-stack web development using React.js and Node.js, as well as back-development and databases. 
        <br><br>
        
        In my spare time, I enjoy lifting heavy weights, watching various tv shows and the occasional table tennis rally. 
        <br><br>
        Feel free to connect with me through email or <a class="links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amos-ko/">Linkedin</a>!</p>

      <p>KoJobs is an online web app built for both employers and job seekers. Guest users can search for and apply to jobs for free! To post a job, users must create an employer account and be successfully verified by an admin.<br><br>
        The back-end utilizes Node.js for Salesforce API integration and React JS for the front-end. Bootstrap is also used for icons and styling.
